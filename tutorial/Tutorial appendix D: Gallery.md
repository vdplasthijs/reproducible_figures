## Gallery of published papers with reproducible figures
_Please suggest any papers you know (via pull request) to be added to this list!_

The goal of this collection is to give some inspiration. Look at the figures here, and if you see elements of a figure that you like and/or want to incorporate into your work, you can just look up and use the underlying code! 

#### Conditions to be included:
- Paper/figure must be open-access (i.e., publicly available)
- Code must be available and open-source (please include a link)
- Code must clearly show where figure was created (preferably, in a Jupyter notebook where the output of a cell is the figure as a whole)
